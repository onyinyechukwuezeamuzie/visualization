Visualization_2 (please see image in folder)

What software did you use to create your data visualization?
I created this visualization with excel.

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    Framers, vendors in the egg industry, the Agricultural sector of government.
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 

    I am trying to show the scale of production of eggs in the Ontario egg indutry from 1998-2024, and also how productive the hens are.  I would also like to show the comparison between scale and efficiency to see if production growth is mostly from more hens or from better efficiency. A secod chart also shows how egg production changed over the years. In sum the 2-in-1 chart show the drivers of egg production and the overall trend of egg production in ontario.

    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots?
    
     I thought about what type of chart would present this information in the cleanest simple accessible way given the tool (excel) I was using and decided to use a line chart. 
    I kept things simple and intuitive by bolding the clearly labelled axes. To avoid losing visual appeal, I presented the charts in 3-D. Using two charts as oppposed to one chart reduced clutter since there were different messages that I was trying to convey as shown in the purpose of my visualization above. 

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 

    I ensured reproducibility by using excel. The same excel functions can be used to reproduce the charts when the same dataset is used. 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  

In addition to using a friendly color palette and  descriptive labels, i also addded alternative text for both images in order to make them accessible to visually impaired people.

    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  

    The Ontario department on Agriculture, farmers and egg vendors.

    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization?

    I selected the features of my dataset to be included or excluded in my visulaization based on their relevance to the purposes I stated in question 1. For example, to show the overal trend of egg production in ontario across the years 2008-2024, I only included the columns: year and Total production. 

    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?

 
◦ Designers that cretaed the color palette I used
◦ Programmers (microsoft excel)
◦ Researchers twho facilitated data collection and anlyses
◦ Farmers who kept accurate records of their livestock and egg production and made those records available.
