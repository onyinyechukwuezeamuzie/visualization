Visualization_1 (please see image in folder).

What software did you use to create your data visualization?
I created this visualization with python.

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    My audience is the Canadian police department.
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    I am trying to show the trend of the severity of non-violent violent crimes from year 2008-2012 across regions in Canada aand Canada as a whole.
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    I considered visual appeal, the purpose of muy design, and clarity of information. To ensure that the info represented on the visualization is clear and not cumbersome to read and understand, I made use of different color palettes to represent different information. Most importantly, in order to ensure that the severity of non-violent crimes in different regions are made obvious, I went with a heatmap rather than say, a line plot or bar graph. in addition, a key is provided for the heatmap showing difffernt hues and their corresponding indices. The more intense the hue, the higher the crime index. It makes it very clear for the audience to see the regions with higher crime index. I also used the patches function to make the opverall crime index for Canada over the years to stand out. That way, the audience can immediately see the downward trend of the crime index without going through the regions one-by-one. 

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    I ensured reproducibility by using Python (pandas + matplotlib / seaborn). The codes I ran can be run on the same datset to produce the same results and they are well commented on.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
In addition to using a friendly color palette, I made sure that my axes labels are very descriptive, the font sizes for my texts are also very readable and they are not overly stylized. I used grid lines to make each data point identifiable. 
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    Those impacted by visualization include the police, the government, individuals and families seeking to live in the regions represented on the visualization.

    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization?
    I simply excluded information that are not part of the core data such as footnote and other metadata information.
    
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    Community organizers who facilitated data collection
◦ Designers that cretaed the color palette I used
◦ Programmers (matplotlib, python, pandas)
◦ Researchers that collected and analysed the data
◦ Police officers that have contributed in fighting crimes in the regions that have seen downward trends in their crime index.
